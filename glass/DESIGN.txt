# DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

# The python list is being used to model a deck of cards,
# such that a 'card' or more generally, an item in the list,
# can be any python object. The only convention we need to
# establish is which end of the list (reasonably considered
# an array in this context as well) will be labeled as the
# top of the deck.

# A Top of deck = start of list/array convetion will be used:

# - Top of deck, first card in deck = first item in list
#   (Top of deck is the left side of the list.)
#   Operations to 'REMOVE a card from the TOP of the deck'
#   will be equivalent to: deck_list.pop(0)
#   Operations to 'ADD a card to the TOP of the deck'
#   will be equivalent to: deck_list.insert(0, card_to_add)

# - Bottom of deck, last card in deck = last item in list
#   (Bottom of deck is the right side of the list.)
#   Operations to 'REMOVE a card from the BOTTOM of the deck'
#   will be equivalent to: deck_list.pop(-1) or deck_list.pop()
#   Operations to 'ADD a card to the BOTTOM of the deck'
#   will be equivalent to: deck_list.append(card_to_add)
